# sovdev-logger Claude Code Skills

This directory contains Claude Code skills for implementing sovdev-logger in new programming languages.

## Overview

These skills codify the systematic implementation guidance from the `specification/` folder into automatically-invoked workflows that guide LLM-assisted development.

## Available Skills

### 1. implement-language
**Invoke**: "implement sovdev-logger in {language}" (e.g., "implement sovdev-logger in Rust")

**Purpose**: Systematic 7-phase implementation guidance following the specification checklist

**Key Features**:
- Automatically references critical documents (tools/README.md, llm-work-templates/research-otel-sdk-guide.md, llm-work-templates/ROADMAP-template.md)
- Enforces Phase 0 (pre-implementation setup) completion before coding
- Updates checklist systematically as work progresses
- Prevents "complete" claims until ALL validation criteria met
- References validation tools documentation

**What it prevents**:
- ❌ Skipping language toolchain verification
- ❌ Not studying OTEL SDK differences
- ❌ Claiming "complete" without Grafana validation
- ❌ Forgetting SDK comparison document

### 2. validate-implementation
**Invoke**: "validate the implementation" or "check if {language} is correct"

**Purpose**: Complete validation suite ensuring file logs, OTLP backends, AND Grafana dashboards all work

**Key Features**:
- Runs file log validation FIRST (fast, local feedback)
- Runs OTLP backend validation SECOND (slow, requires infrastructure)
- Checks Grafana dashboard (the CRITICAL step often missed)
- Compares metric labels with TypeScript exactly
- Cross-references with completion checklist
- References validation tools documentation

**Validation sequence**:
1. File logs (instant) - catches ~90% of issues
2. OTLP backends (10s wait) - tests infrastructure
3. Grafana dashboard (manual) - verifies ALL 3 panels show data
4. Metric labels (comparison) - ensures consistency

### 3. development-loop
**Invoke**: "test changes" or "run the development loop"

**Purpose**: Iterative 4-step workflow for rapid development with fast feedback

**Key Features**:
- Follows specification/09-development-loop.md workflow
- Enforces "validate log files FIRST" (instant feedback)
- Executes commands directly (LLM runs inside DevContainer)
- Handles build step when needed
- Only validates OTLP after file logs pass
- References validation tools documentation

**Development loop steps**:
1. Edit code (Read/Edit/Write tools)
2. Build library (when source changed)
3. Run test (in DevContainer)
4. Validate logs FIRST ⚡ (instant)
5. Validate OTLP SECOND 🔄 (after propagation delay)

### 4. validation-tools
**Invoke**: "which tool should I use?" or "query loki" or "debug validation failure"

**Purpose**: Directs you to comprehensive tool documentation for selecting and using validation/query tools

**Key Features**:
- Points to authoritative tool documentation (`specification/tools/README.md`)
- Provides context for when to consult tools
- No duplication - references single source of truth
- Guides tool selection for debugging

**What it prevents**:
- ❌ Not knowing tools documentation exists
- ❌ Using wrong validation tool
- ❌ Manually inspecting logs instead of using query tools
- ❌ Misunderstanding validation layers

## How Skills Work

Skills are **automatically invoked** by Claude Code when your request matches the skill description. You don't need to explicitly call skills - Claude will use them when appropriate.

**Example conversation**:
```
You: "Implement sovdev-logger in Rust"
Claude: [Automatically uses implement-language skill]
        "I'll guide you through implementing sovdev-logger in Rust
        following the 7-phase systematic process..."
```

## Shared Components

**To avoid duplication, common content is maintained in `_SHARED.md`:**

### What's Shared
- **Directory Restrictions**: Access rules for terchris/, .devcontainer.secrets/, specification/, etc.
- **Execute Commands Warning**: Critical reminder to execute commands, not describe them
- **Common Cross-References**: Frequently referenced specification documents

### Why Share
- **Single Source of Truth**: Update once, applies to all skills
- **Consistency**: All skills use identical wording for critical guidance
- **Maintainability**: Changes to common patterns only need one edit

### How Skills Reference Shared Content
Each skill includes:
```markdown
## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Directory Restrictions

**See:** `.claude/skills/_SHARED.md` → "Directory Restrictions"

**Summary:** [Brief inline summary for quick reference]
```

This pattern:
- ✅ Eliminates ~95 lines of duplication
- ✅ Provides quick summary inline
- ✅ Points to complete details in _SHARED.md
- ✅ Makes maintenance easier

## Skills as Routers Philosophy (v3.0)

**Skills do NOT duplicate content. Skills are minimal routers.**

### What Skills Contain

Skills contain:
- ✅ **WHEN** to use which documentation (intent matching)
- ✅ **WHERE** to find authoritative information (file paths)
- ✅ **WHICH** section to read (section names)
- ✅ **Minimal actionable steps** (initialize, read instructions)
- ❌ **NOT** meta commentary, examples, or duplicated procedures

### Why Minimal

**Rationale:** LLMs can read files instantly. No benefit to duplicating content or explaining WHY the system works.

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **Single source of truth** - Update once, not in multiple places
- ✅ **Less context waste** - Read instructions once in the actual document
- ✅ **No sync issues** - Can't have outdated duplicated content
- ✅ **Easier maintenance** - Update specification, done
- ✅ **Clearer intent** - Skills say WHEN/WHERE, specs say HOW

### Skills Updated to v3.0

All skills radically simplified (2025-10-31):
- ✅ `implement-language` - 330 → 90 lines (72% reduction)
- ✅ `validation-tools` - 133 → 67 lines (50% reduction)
- ✅ `development-loop` - 143 → 83 lines (42% reduction)
- ✅ `validate-implementation` - 97 → 84 lines (13% reduction)

**Total: 703 → 324 lines (54% overall reduction, -379 lines removed)**

**Removed:**
- Meta commentary about system design
- Duplicated workflow procedures
- Example walkthroughs
- Reference document lists
- Historical version information
- Success criteria (belongs in specs)
- Descriptions of what's IN files (just read them)

**Kept:**
- Minimal actionable steps (initialize, read)
- Pointers to authoritative documentation
- Troubleshooting routing (where to look for help)

### Maintenance

When updating specifications:
1. Update the specification file (single source of truth)
2. Done - skills just point to specifications

**No duplication to maintain.**

## Benefits

### For LLM Implementations
- ✅ **Prevents Common Mistakes**: Enforces documented best practices
- ✅ **Systematic Progress**: Updates checklist as work progresses
- ✅ **Complete Validation**: No premature "complete" claims
- ✅ **References Specification**: Always uses latest docs
- ✅ **Tool Discovery**: Guides you to validation tools documentation

### For Team Collaboration
- ✅ **Shared Workflow**: All team members use same approach
- ✅ **Git Integration**: Skills committed to repo, versioned with code
- ✅ **Self-Documenting**: Skills show "the right way"
- ✅ **Reduced Onboarding**: New developers see structured guidance

### For Project Quality
- ✅ **Consistent Implementations**: All languages follow same process
- ✅ **Documentation Alignment**: Skills reference specification
- ✅ **Quality Gates**: Each phase has verification criteria
- ✅ **No Duplication**: Skills reference tools README, don't duplicate it

## Relationship to Specification

These skills **do not replace** the specification - they **guide** you through it and **reference** the authoritative documentation:

| Specification Document | Used By Skill | Purpose |
|------------------------|---------------|---------|
| `specification/README.md` | implement-language | Overall guidance |
| **`specification/tools/README.md`** | **ALL skills** | **Complete validation tool reference** |
| `specification/llm-work-templates/ROADMAP-template.md` | implement-language | 13-task implementation workflow |
| `specification/llm-work-templates/validation-sequence.md` | validate-implementation | 8-step validation sequence |
| `specification/llm-work-templates/research-otel-sdk-guide.md` | implement-language | OTEL SDK differences |
| `specification/09-development-loop.md` | development-loop | Iterative workflow |
| `specification/01-api-contract.md` | implement-language | API requirements |

**Key Principle:** Skills are signposts, not encyclopedias. They point to the right documentation rather than duplicating it.

## Manual Alternative

If not using Claude Code, you can still implement sovdev-logger manually by following:
1. `specification/README.md` - Quick start guide
2. `specification/llm-work-templates/ROADMAP-template.md` - 13-task workflow
3. `specification/llm-work-templates/validation-sequence.md` - 8-step validation
4. `specification/09-development-loop.md` - Development workflow
5. `specification/tools/README.md` - Complete validation tool reference

The skills simply make this process automatic and harder to skip steps.
