# Task 1: Check OTEL SDK Maturity for [LANGUAGE]

**Parent task**: ROADMAP.md - Phase 0, Task 1
**Prerequisites**: None (first task)

---

## Purpose

Verify that the OpenTelemetry SDK for [LANGUAGE] is mature enough to use for sovdev-logger implementation.

**Output**: Documented SDK maturity status for Traces, Metrics, and Logs

---

## Subtasks

### 1.1 Visit OpenTelemetry Languages Page

- [ ] Open browser to https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/
- [ ] Find [LANGUAGE] in the language list
- [ ] Click on [LANGUAGE] to open the language-specific documentation

**Expected result**: Language-specific OpenTelemetry documentation page

---

### 1.2 Check Signal Maturity Status

On the languages page, find the "Status and Releases" table.

- [ ] Locate [LANGUAGE] in the status table
- [ ] Record maturity status for each signal:
  - [ ] **Traces**: _________________ (Stable/Beta/Development)
  - [ ] **Metrics**: _________________ (Stable/Beta/Development)
  - [ ] **Logs**: _________________ (Stable/Beta/Development)

**Success criteria:**
- ✅ **All three signals are "Stable" or "Beta"** → Proceed with implementation
- ⚠️ **Any signal is "Development"** → Document risks and limitations below
- ❌ **Logs signal missing** → Escalate to user (cannot implement without logs)

---

### 1.3 Document Findings

Record the maturity status in your workspace:

**SDK Maturity Status for [LANGUAGE]:**
```
Source: https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/[language]
Date checked: [DATE]

Traces:  [Stable/Beta/Development]
Metrics: [Stable/Beta/Development]
Logs:    [Stable/Beta/Development]
```

**If any signal is Beta or Development, document known limitations:**
```
[List any known limitations from the documentation]
```

---

### 1.4 Verify GitHub Repository Exists

- [ ] Find GitHub repository link on the documentation page
- [ ] Expected format: https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-[language]
- [ ] Verify repository exists and has activity (not abandoned)
- [ ] Record repository URL: _______________________________

**Success criteria:**
- ✅ Repository exists
- ✅ Recent commits (within last 6 months)
- ❌ No repository or abandoned → Escalate to user

---

### 1.5 Check Latest Stable Version

**CRITICAL**: Always use the latest stable (or latest RC if needed) version.

- [ ] Visit package repository for [LANGUAGE]:
  - **C#**: https://www.nuget.org/packages/OpenTelemetry
  - **Python**: https://pypi.org/project/opentelemetry-api/
  - **Go**: https://pkg.go.dev/go.opentelemetry.io/otel
  - **Rust**: https://crates.io/crates/opentelemetry
  - **Java**: https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.opentelemetry
  - **JavaScript/TypeScript**: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@opentelemetry/api
  - **PHP**: https://packagist.org/packages/open-telemetry/api
- [ ] Record latest STABLE version: _________________
- [ ] Record latest RC/Beta version (if any): _________________
- [ ] Check release date of latest version: _________________
- [ ] Document version selection rationale:
  ```
  Selected version: [X.Y.Z]
  Reason: [Latest stable | Latest RC for critical fixes | Specific reason]
  Release date: [DATE]
  ```

**Decision criteria**:
- ✅ **Prefer latest stable** - Use this by default
- ⚠️ **Use latest RC only if**:
  - Critical bug fix needed (e.g., histogram serialization in OpenTelemetry .NET 1.14.0-rc.1)
  - Stable version has known blocking issue
  - RC is close to stable release (within 1-2 weeks)
- ❌ **Never use**:
  - Alpha versions
  - Versions older than 6 months (unless language-specific reason)
  - Versions with known security issues

**Why this matters**:
- Bug fixes accumulate in newer versions
- Using outdated versions = debugging already-fixed issues
- Saves hours of troubleshooting time

**Example documentation**:
```
Language: C#
Package: OpenTelemetry
Latest stable: 1.13.1 (released 2025-09-15)
Latest RC: 1.14.0-rc.1 (released 2025-10-21)
Selected: 1.14.0-rc.1
Reason: Includes histogram serialization fixes for OTLP (addresses known issue #4797)
```

## Success Criteria

**This task is complete when:**

- [ ] All subtasks checked off (including 1.5 - latest version)
- [ ] SDK maturity verified for all 3 signals (Traces, Metrics, Logs)
- [ ] All signals are "Stable" or "Beta" (no "Development")
- [ ] GitHub repository URL recorded
- [ ] **Latest version checked and documented**
- [ ] **Version selection rationale provided**
- [ ] Any limitations documented
- [ ] Ready to proceed to Task 2

**Do NOT mark complete if:**
- ❌ Any signal is missing or "Development"
- ❌ Cannot find [LANGUAGE] in OpenTelemetry documentation
- ❌ GitHub repository doesn't exist or is abandoned
- ❌ **Latest version not checked**
- ❌ **Using version older than 6 months without rationale**

---

## Common Issues

### Issue 1: Language Not Listed
**Problem**: Cannot find [LANGUAGE] in OpenTelemetry languages list
**Solution**: Language may not be officially supported. Check for community implementations or escalate to user.

### Issue 2: Logs Signal Not Supported
**Problem**: Logs signal is "Development" or missing
**Solution**: Cannot implement sovdev-logger without logs support. Escalate to user for alternative language.

### Issue 3: All Signals are Beta
**Problem**: Signals are Beta, not Stable
**Solution**: Beta is acceptable but document that APIs might change. Proceed with caution.

---

## Validation

**Before marking complete, verify:**

```bash
# No command needed - this is a documentation task
```

**All checks:**
- [ ] Traces, Metrics, Logs maturity documented
- [ ] GitHub repository URL recorded
- [ ] Decision made: Proceed or escalate

---

**Parent task**: Return to ROADMAP.md when complete
**Next task**: Task 2 - Verify TypeScript baseline
