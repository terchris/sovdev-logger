# Task 4: Create SDK Comparison Document

**Parent task**: ROADMAP.md - Phase 0, Task 4
**Prerequisites**: Task 3 complete (SDK research done)

---

## Purpose

Complete and structure the comprehensive comparison document started in Task 3.

**Input**: Initial research notes from Task 3 (`[LANGUAGE]/llm-work/otel-sdk-comparison.md`)

**Output**: Complete `[LANGUAGE]/llm-work/otel-sdk-comparison.md` with all critical implementation details

**Why this matters:** This task adds critical sections not covered in Task 3 (duration handling, histogram units, workarounds) that are essential for implementation. The completed document becomes the reference for understanding how [LANGUAGE] SDK differs from TypeScript.

---

## Subtasks

### 4.1 Review Initial Research Notes

- [ ] Open file created in Task 3: `[LANGUAGE]/llm-work/otel-sdk-comparison.md`
- [ ] Review initial research findings
- [ ] Verify basic sections are present (SDK maturity, packages, OTLP config, HTTP headers, metric attributes)
- [ ] If file is missing → Go back to Task 3.8

---

### 4.2 Document SDK Maturity Status

From Task 1 findings:

- [ ] Copy maturity status (Traces, Metrics, Logs)
- [ ] Include source URL and date checked
- [ ] Document any limitations for Beta/Development signals

**Section content:**
```markdown
## SDK Maturity Status

Source: https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/[language]
Date checked: [DATE]

- **Traces**: [Stable/Beta/Development]
- **Metrics**: [Stable/Beta/Development]
- **Logs**: [Stable/Beta/Development]

### Known Limitations

[List any Beta/Development limitations]
```

---

### 4.3 Document Required Packages

From Task 3.3 findings:

- [ ] List all OTEL packages needed
- [ ] Include package names, versions, purpose
- [ ] Document installation commands

**Section content:**
```markdown
## Packages Required

| Package | Purpose | Installation |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| [package-name] | OTLP logs exporter | [install command] |
| [package-name] | OTLP metrics exporter | [install command] |
| [package-name] | OTLP traces exporter | [install command] |
| [package-name] | HTTP client (if custom needed) | [install command] |

**Installation:**
\`\`\`bash
[combined install command]
\`\`\`
```

---

### 4.4 Document OTLP Exporter Configuration

From Task 3.3 findings:

- [ ] Show how to configure OTLP exporters
- [ ] Include code example for each signal (logs, metrics, traces)
- [ ] Document endpoint configuration
- [ ] Document HTTP header configuration

**Section content:**
```markdown
## OTLP Exporter Configuration

### Logs Exporter
\`\`\`[language]
[Code example showing OTLP logs exporter configuration]
\`\`\`

### Metrics Exporter
\`\`\`[language]
[Code example showing OTLP metrics exporter configuration]
\`\`\`

### Traces Exporter
\`\`\`[language]
[Code example showing OTLP traces exporter configuration]
\`\`\`
```

---

### 4.5 Document HTTP Headers Configuration (CRITICAL)

From Task 3.4 findings:

- [ ] Document HOW to set custom HTTP headers
- [ ] Include code example with `Host: otel.localhost`
- [ ] Note if per-exporter or global configuration

**Section content:**
```markdown
## HTTP Headers Configuration ⚠️ CRITICAL

**Required header:** \`Host: otel.localhost\`

### How to Set Headers in [LANGUAGE]

\`\`\`[language]
[Code example showing how to set custom HTTP headers]
\`\`\`

**Notes:**
- [Per-exporter or global?]
- [Any SDK-specific quirks?]
- [Alternative approaches if needed]
```

---

### 4.6 Document Metric Attributes Pattern (CRITICAL)

From Task 3.5 findings:

- [ ] Document HOW to create metric attributes
- [ ] Show CORRECT pattern (underscores)
- [ ] Show WRONG pattern (dots) with warning
- [ ] Include code examples

**Section content:**
```markdown
## Metric Attributes Pattern ⚠️ CRITICAL

**MUST use underscores, NOT dots:**
- ✅ Correct: \`peer_service\`, \`log_type\`, \`log_level\`
- ❌ Wrong: \`peer.service\`, \`log.type\`, \`log.level\`

### How to Set Attributes in [LANGUAGE]

**Correct example:**
\`\`\`[language]
[Code showing underscore notation]
\`\`\`

**Wrong example (DO NOT USE):**
\`\`\`[language]
[Code showing dot notation with ❌ markers]
\`\`\`

**Why this matters:** Grafana filtering requires underscores. Dots will break dashboard queries.
```

---

### 4.7 Document Duration Handling (CRITICAL)

From Task 3 research:

- [ ] Document native time unit in [LANGUAGE]
- [ ] Show conversion to milliseconds
- [ ] Include code example

**Section content:**
```markdown
## Duration Recording ⚠️ CRITICAL

**MUST record in milliseconds, NOT seconds.**

### Native Time Unit in [LANGUAGE]

[LANGUAGE] measures time in: [nanoseconds/microseconds/milliseconds/seconds]

### Conversion to Milliseconds

\`\`\`[language]
[Code example showing time capture and conversion to milliseconds]
\`\`\`
```

---

### 4.8 Document Histogram Unit (CRITICAL)

From Task 3 research:

- [ ] Document HOW to specify histogram unit
- [ ] Show code example with \`unit: "ms"\`

**Section content:**
```markdown
## Histogram Unit Specification ⚠️ CRITICAL

**MUST specify unit as "ms" for duration histogram.**

### How to Set Unit in [LANGUAGE]

\`\`\`[language]
[Code example showing histogram creation with unit specification]
\`\`\`

**Why this matters:** Grafana expects milliseconds. Wrong unit causes values to display incorrectly (0.000538 instead of 0.538 ms).
```

---

### 4.9 Document Differences from TypeScript

From Task 3.6 findings:

- [ ] List key differences in API
- [ ] Note different patterns or idioms
- [ ] Document workarounds needed

**Section content:**
```markdown
## Differences from TypeScript

| Aspect | TypeScript | [LANGUAGE] | Notes |
|--------|-----------|------------|-------|
| HTTP headers | \`headers: {...}\` | [method] | [notes] |
| Metric attributes | \`{peer_service: "x"}\` | [method] | [notes] |
| Duration | \`Date.now()\` | [method] | [notes] |
| Histogram unit | \`unit: 'ms'\` | [method] | [notes] |
| Exporter config | [pattern] | [pattern] | [notes] |

### Key Differences Explained

1. **[Difference 1]**
   - TypeScript: [approach]
   - [LANGUAGE]: [approach]
   - Why: [explanation]

2. **[Difference 2]**
   - [Continue pattern]
```

---

### 4.10 Document Workarounds (if any)

If SDK has limitations:

- [ ] Document each workaround
- [ ] Explain why it's needed
- [ ] Show code example
- [ ] Reference issue/PR if applicable

**Section content:**
```markdown

### Workaround 1: [Issue Description]

**Problem:** [What doesn't work out of the box]

**Solution:** [How we work around it]

\`\`\`[language]
[Code example]
\`\`\`

**Reference:** [Link to issue/PR/documentation]
```

---

### 4.11 Add References Section

- [ ] List all URLs consulted
- [ ] Include SDK documentation links
- [ ] Include GitHub repository links

**Section content:**
